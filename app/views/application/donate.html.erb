<p>As I explained on the <a href="/about">About page</a>, while this doesn't cost anything to build, it does take time and effort. I am a student at Brunel University studying Computer Science and I also do front-end web development for my web design agency, <a href="http://5lin.es">5 Lines</a>. All the time I spent building this is time taken away from those two things. While I've really enjoyed building this (and it's taught me Ruby on Rails, which I've always wanted to learn), I still have other work to do. Also, the hosting is free right now (using Heroku's free 750 hours) but this won't last forever and may need to be scaled up at some point. So all in all, very soon I am going to have start paying for this, and if I can't pay it, or find an alternative hosting solution, I will have to take it offline, which I really don't want to have to do.</p>
<p>So if you feel like giving a little money to help me keep it running, that would be amazing! The easiest option is probably PayPal for now - my address is tom.oakley@me.com, or you can email me at that address about other options. Thank you so much!</p>
